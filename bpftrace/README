bpftrace
High-level tracing language for Linux eBPF
github: https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace

Default version: https://github.com/michalgr/bpftrace/tree/compile-for-android

Building:
- bpftrace depends on bcc and needs to be told where to look for headers
  (cmake's -DLIBBCC_INCLUDE_DIRS)
- Android's libc (bionic) has pthreads built-in, there is no need to tell
  linker to do anything when building program using pthreads (in fact
  specifying -lpthreads breaks linking phase as there is no such library).
  For that reasone we set THREADS_PTHREAD_ARG to an empty string
- we need to tell cmake to use flex version that matches the lib and
  headers we have for Android. We set FLEX_EXECUTABLE to point to
  host executable built from the same sources as we use for Android.
